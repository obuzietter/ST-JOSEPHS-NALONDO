                        <p>Its first infrastructure was in form of a classroom block donated by the neighboring Nalondo
                            Primary School. An interim school committee was inaugurated in 1973 with an intake of 11
                            students. Enrollment increased by 20 when the only secondary school in the locality Sipala
                            Secondary School shut down and all students were absorbed into Nalondo Secondary School. The
                            first chairman and headmaster of the school were Messrs. George Masinde and William Wasike
                            respectively. Others were Messrs. John Masete and Peter Makokha. The chairman was an
                            employee of the Bungoma County Council who worked hard to ensure that the school was legally
                            registered as Harambee Mixed Secondary School in 1973. The first TSC principle was Mr. John
                            F Simiyu from 1985 to 1993.</p>

                        <p>At the time, there were only a few government supported secondary schools within the then
                            Bungoma District i.e. Bungoma High School and Kibabii High School. The school was therefore
                            started to meet the local demand of local primary school graduates who could not afford the
                            high fees charged by the available secondary schools over 20 km away. The first case KJSE
                            was in 1975 And EACE was done in 1977 with seven students. Their performance was impressive
                            as they all passed their exams. This encouraged more students to enroll at the school.</p>

                        <p>Through the Harambee Spirit, the locals mobilized resources to improve the school
                            infrastructure. Since the school started with a classroom block donated by the primary
                            school, the community’s first business was to raise the resources to construct one classroom
                            as compensation to the primary school. This facilitated relocation of the primary school
                            lower unit to allow the secondary school operate independently. In addition, the secondary
                            school section was given eight(8) acres of land where the school is situated today.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The late Mr. Wanjala Bunyasi gave a major boost to the school while he served as a village
                            elder. He mobilized and encouraged local community members to bring their children to the
                            school. In addition, the late Assistant Chief Mr. Jotham Khaemba was equally supportive. On
                            top of marshalling students from the community, he mobilized the community to raise funds in
                            support of the school through harambee Spirit. Others who supported the school in its
                            initial stages are former members of Parliament, notably Messrs. Hon. Peter. Kisuya, Joseph
                            Muliro, John Barasa, Munyasia, Moses Wetang’ula. And the current MP, Mr. James Lusweti. The
                            school picked up and got recognised in the locality in the 1980s and 1990s.
